# bollytekk-site

A minimal, modern, Indian-themed site for Bollytekk — showcasing music, videos, and the beauty of Indian culture.

## About Bollytekk
Bollytekk is a genre pioneered by Reesh, Roro, and Saif — a genre-bending fusion of traditional Indian sounds and modern hip-hop energy. Inspired by the deep rhythms of tablas, the shimmering melodies of sitars, and the cinematic sweep of Bollywood, Bollytekk blends them with hard-hitting trap drums, lush cloud-rap atmospheres, and intricate lyricism. It’s more than just music — it’s a bridge between cultures, honoring Indian heritage while pushing global sound forward. Every track is a celebration of beauty, identity, and rhythm, crafted to move both heart and head.
